## Project Overview
This project is a browser-based version of an Etch-A-Sketch done for "The Odin Project" Foundations Course. It functions as a simple drawing tool that allows users to sketch by hovering over a grid of squares, with added features for resetting the grid and gradually darkening hover effects.

- **Reset Functionality:**
  - A button to clear the grid and optionally set a new grid size.

### Technology Stack
- **HTML:** Used for the basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS:** Styled the grid container and squares using Flexbox.
- **JavaScript:**
  - Dynamically creates the grid.
  - Adds interactive hover effects and reset functionality.
