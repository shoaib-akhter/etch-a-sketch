# etch-a-sketch

## Project Overview
This project is a browser-based version of an Etch-A-Sketch done for "The Odin Project" Foundations Course. It functions as a simple drawing tool that allows users to sketch by hovering over a grid of squares, with added features for resetting the grid and gradually darkening hover effects.

### Current Features
- **Dynamic Grid Creation:**
  - A grid of square divs is dynamically generated using JavaScript.
  - The grid size is customizable.
- **Hover Effects:**
  - Grid squares change color upon hover.
  - Progressive darkening: Each interaction darkens the square by 10%, achieving full color in 10 interactions.
- **Reset Functionality:**
  - A button to reset the grid, now labeled "RESET" with a cream-yellow design.
  - Optionally allows the user to set a new grid size.

### Technology Stack
- **HTML:** Used for the basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS:** Styled the grid container, button, and squares using Flexbox.
- **JavaScript:**

  - Adds hover effects, reset functionality, and interactive design.

### How to Use
